<h2>Data Collection </h2> 

<p>I took five runs from throughout the history of Dark Souls speedrunning to individually examine and map. One of the runs is the oldest recorded speedrun. One is the world record run as of  4/21/2022. (Someone set a new record right after I finished mapping the others, it uses the same route as the other record, it just makes fewer mistakes). The other three runs were chosen as they are each the world record before a major route change and thus represent a pinnacle of a given route. </p>

<h2>Map Creation</h2>
<p>To create maps I decided on using photoshop using an accurate fan-created map by Fillipe Ramos as the background and manually drawing the route for each run on a separate layer and then exporting each layer with the background. Because of this, the maps are necessarily imperfect representations of the routes. In addition, I added a map of the DLC areas into the background which is used in one of the runs. These DLC maps were taken from <a href="http://www.kouryakubo.com/darksouls_en/"> here</a></p>

<h2>What is a speedrun? </h2> 
<p>To start discussing how the Dark Souls any% speedrun has changed, we must first understand what speedrunning is. Speedrunning is the task of completing a specified goal in a game as quickly as possible, which is then divided into categories based upon the goal of the run, and what restrictions are placed upon it. In the any% category, the goal is the finish the game as quickly as possible while using any tricks or glitches in the game to achieve that goal. </p>  
<h2>What is Dark Souls? </h2> 
<p>Dark Souls is an action-adventure rpg released on September 22, 2011. In a normal playthrough,to finish the game a player must do the following after leaving the tutorial area and being dropped at the game's hub area, Firelink Shrine. They first must ring two bells to open the gates of Sen's Fortress. One bell is in the underground area blightown and another in the Undead Parish.  After ringing both bells the player must travel through Sen's Fortress and through the following area Anor Londo. After defeating the boss of Anor Londo, the player is given the Lordvessel and tasked with filling it with four lord souls. The four lord souls are acquired from defeating four different lords which each lie at the end of their own respective area. The Bed of Chaos in Izalith, The Four Kings in the Abyss beneath new Londo, Seath in the Duke's Archives, and Nito in the Tomb of the Giants. Once all four lord souls have been acquired, the door to the game's final area, The Kiln of the First Flame, is opened. The game ends once the player defeats the boss at the end of the area. </p>
<h2>The First Run</h2> 
<p>Less than a month after the game's release, on October 15, a player named Twilight uploaded his run of the game to YouTube with a time of 1:26:28. Twilight begins as the pyromancer class with the master key as his starting gift. After reaching firelink shrine, he first grabs the ring of sacrifice, an item which prevents the player from losing Humanity on death. He then goes to undead burg, where after defeating an early boss, he spends a momnet slicing off the bridge drake's tail to get the Drake Sword. With this powerful early-game weapon, he defeats the gargoyles and rings the first bell. Then, using the master key, he opens a shortcut to blightown, travels to its bottom and defeats the second bell guardian and rings it. Twilight speaks to an npc here to join the Chaos Witch covenent which gives him a powerful pyromancy spell On his way out of blightown he speaks with a pyromancy merchant to buy more spells. These pyromancy spells are his main weapon from this point forth in the run. With the bells rung, he makes his way through Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo, using the new pyromancy spells to defeat enemies, and acquires the lordvessel. Of the four lords Twilight first goes to Duke's Archives. In the Duke's Archives, the player  enters a forced death sequence where they are killed by Seath and put into a prison they must escape. Twilight uses the Ring of sacrifice he acquired earlier to avoid losing anything during this sequence. Twilight defeats Seath, and makes his way to the Tomb of the Giants next. Here, he makes a slight detour to kill several npcs before completing the area. The next area he goes through is New Londo, where he makes a stop to pick up a bow and arrow. After defeating the Four Kings, Twilight moves on to the last of the four lords, first by returning to blightown. Throughout the run, Twilight has been gathering items called humanity which drop from bosses and npcs. By donating thirty humanity to the Chaos Witch covenent, a shortcut is opened which allows Twilight to go straight to the boss, Bed of Chaos. Twilight uses the bow acquired ealier to defeat this boss. With all four lord souls acquired, Twilight heads directly to the last boss and finishes the run with a time of 1:26:28.  </p>

<h2>Breaking the Game </h2>
<p>While Twilight's initial run of the game remained glitchless, glitches would be discovered which allowed runners to skip through areas and defeat bosses faster. These glitches, combined with a change in weapon used, led to a change in the route. Kahmul78's run on January 7, 2015, was the best of this route before a number of other glitches began being discovered. Kahmul's run would begin as the hunter starting class also choosing the master key. After reaching firelink shrine, he immediately heads downward to New Londo. He passes through the first half of area, using the bow he starts with to kill an npc from a distance, to avoid needing to walk to him to get a key. After using the key to open up the second half of the area, Kahmul leaves a back exit of the area and to the Undead Parish. On the way he grabs the black knight halberd, which will be the main weapon for the run. The major glitch used from this point forth is called moveswap. This glitch is performed by attempting to two-hand a bow and swapping to a differnt weapon while in the middle of another animation such as a jump. This causes the game to give your right hand weapon the moveset of whatever weapon is in your left hand. The speedrun will perform this glitch before most boss fights to give the Black Knight Halberd the moveset of the estoc to combine the fast attacks of the estoc with the high damage of the halberd. Kahmul's run then plays out similarly to Twilight's with several changes. Kahmul does not acquire the pyromancy spells nor does he gather humanity to open the shortcut as the damage from makes it faster to move through the area normally. When going through the Duke's Archives, Kahmul performs a difficult skip which involves a precise jump off an elevator which avoids the forced death and imprisonment sequence. The optimizations and skips throughout Kahmul's run as well as the increased damage from moveswap allows Kahmul to finish the game im 50:09. </p>

<h2>Data Collection </h2> 

<p>I took five runs from throughout the history of Dark Souls speedrunning to individually examine and map. One of the runs is the oldest recorded speedrun. One is the world record run as of  4/21/2022. (Someone set a new record right after I finished mapping the others, it uses the same route as the other record, it just makes fewer mistakes). The other three runs were chosen as they are each the world record before a major route change and thus represent a pinnacle of a given route. </p>

<h2>Map Creation</h2>
<p>To create maps I decided on using photoshop using an accurate fan-created map by Fillipe Ramos as the background and manually drawing the route for each run on a separate layer and then exporting each layer with the background. Because of this, the maps are necessarily imperfect representations of the routes. In addition, I added a map of the DLC areas into the background which is used in one of the runs. These DLC maps were taken from <a href="http://www.kouryakubo.com/darksouls_en/"> here</a></p>

<h2>What is a speedrun? </h2> 
<p>To start discussing how the Dark Souls any% speedrun has changed, we must first understand what speedrunning is. Speedrunning is the task of completing a specified goal in a game as quickly as possible, which is then divided into categories based upon the goal of the run, and what restrictions are placed upon it. In the any% category, the goal is the finish the game as quickly as possible while using any tricks or glitches in the game to achieve that goal. </p>  
<h2>The First Run</h2> 
<p>Dark Souls released on September 22, 2011. Less than a month later, on October 15, a player named Twilight would perform the very first speedrun of Dark Souls.  </p>
